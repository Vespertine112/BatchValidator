    <p class="body-text">I feel like all my kids grew up, and then they married each other. It's every parent's dream.

The worst thing about prison was the... was the dementors. They were flying all over the place and they were scary and then they'd come down and they'd suck the soul out of your body. And it hurt!

It's subtle. This is how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. And, then she looks at me and then she looks at the image then back at me then back at the image, soon she doesn't know what is me what is the image, she just knows that she is turned on.

When I retire, I don't want to just move to some island somewhere. I want to be the guy who gives it all back. I want it to be like, 'Hey... who donated that hospital wing that's saving so many lives?' 'I don't know. It was anonymous.' 'Well, guess what. It was Michael Scott.' 'But how do you know? It was anonymous.' [pause] 'Because I'm him.'

Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but, basically, you make someone think the opposite of what you believe. And that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.

We had a foreign exchange student when I was young. And, we called him my brother, and that's what I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans, with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like: A fake brother who steals your jeans.

Business to business. The old fashion way. No blackberries. No websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people.

My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17%, or cut expenditure without losing a single member of staff. No, no no. It was a young Guatamalan guy, first job in the country, hardly spoke a word of English, but he came to me, and said, 'Mr. Scott, will you be, the Godfather to my child?' Wow... wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.

I live by one rule: No office romances, no way. Very messy, inappropriate... no. But, I live by another rule: Just do it... Nike.</p>
